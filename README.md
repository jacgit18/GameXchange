# GameXchange
Game trading service


![Alt text](GameXchange/game-xchange.png?raw=true "Systemm Design View")




# Motivation:
As a gamer, I was thinking about when I used to buy games at GameStop and how I would trade games to save money but was wondering why with all the different subscription services out there, why aren't any game trading services out there, renting is cool but sometimes you want to play a game in the spur of the moment thus GameXchange was born.
